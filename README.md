# LLM Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning process in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI. It contains notes, hands-on Jupyter notebooks, and experiments based on structured online courses and personal research.

## Purpose

To build a solid foundation in LLMs by combining theory with practical implementations, and to demonstrate continued learning and initiative in the field.

## Topics 

1. Introduction to Generative AI
2. Foundation Models and Architecture
3. Prompt Engineering Techniques
4. Fine-Tuning and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
<!---5. Evaluation of LLMs
6. Responsible AI and Model Deployment!-->

## Repository Structure

Each module folder includes:
- `notes.md`: Key takeaways and summarized concepts.
- `.ipynb`: Interactive examples and implementations using Hugging Face, PyTorch, and other tools.
